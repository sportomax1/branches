    <h1>The History of the iPhone</h1>
    <p class="lead">A concise, chaptered narrative that walks through the iPhone's key milestones from 2007 to the present.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>Origins (before 2007)</h2>
      <p>Apple's iPhone grew out of two parallel efforts: a touchscreen iPod project and a secret mobile phone initiative. Apple combined ideas from its iPod team, the Mac OS team, and work on touch interfaces to create a device focused on an intuitive multitouch display and mobile web experiences.</p>
      <div class="small">Analogy: imagine taking a tiny computer, a music player, and a phone, then redesigning the whole interface so you control it with your fingers instead of buttons.</div>

      <h2>Key milestones</h2>
      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2007 — iPhone (1st gen)</div>
        <p>Announced by Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007 and released June 29, 2007. Featured a 3.5" multitouch display, 2 MP camera, visual voicemail, and mobile Safari. It was a phone, an iPod, and an Internet communicator.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2008 — App Store & iPhone 3G</div>
        <p>Apple opened the App Store in July 2008, enabling third-party apps and establishing the modern smartphone ecosystem. The iPhone 3G added faster cellular data and GPS.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2010 — iPhone 4</div>
        <p>Introduced a high-resolution "Retina" display, a glass-and-steel design, and the front-facing camera for FaceTime video calls.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2011–2013 — Rapid refinement</div>
        <p>iPhone 4S added Siri in 2011; iPhone 5 introduced a taller screen and Lightning connector in 2012; the product line continued performance and camera improvements.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2014 — iPhone 6 / 6 Plus</div>
        <p>Apple expanded screen sizes to compete with larger Android handsets; NFC and Apple Pay were introduced for mobile payments.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2016–2017 — Cameras and displays</div>
        <p>Dual cameras, improved image processing, and OLED displays arrived across Pro-tier models; iPhone X (2017) marked the 10th anniversary with a notch, Face ID, and gesture-based navigation.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2019–2021 — Performance & Services</div>
        <p>Apple's in-house A-series chips pushed performance leaps; 5G support arrived with iPhone 12 series; Apple increasingly tied hardware to services (iCloud, Apple Music, Apple Arcade).</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">2022–2024 — AI, cameras, and modular updates</div>
        <p>Focus shifted to AI-assisted photography, Pro-level video features, satellite SOS, and deeper on-device ML. Apple refined computational photography and added more on-device intelligence.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="entry"><div class="year">Today</div>
        <p>The iPhone is a mature platform combining high-performance silicon, advanced cameras, and tight hardware-software integration. Its ecosystem and App Store remain central to mobile software distribution.</p>
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Impact & ecosystem</h2>
      <p>The iPhone changed how people access the Internet, transforming industries such as photography, music, mapping, and communication. The App Store created new businesses and shifted developer distribution models.</p>
      <p class="small">Analogy: the iPhone was less like a new product and more like building a new highway system — it unlocked new traffic (apps, services, behaviors) that changed whole cities (industries).</p>
