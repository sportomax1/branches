 # Coffee Shop — Business Model (Dev)

 ## Overview

 This document describes a simple business model for running a small neighborhood coffee shop. It's intended as a starting point for planning, financial projections, and operational checklists.

 ## Value Proposition

 - High-quality espresso, drip coffee, and tea
 - Fresh pastries and light breakfast items
 - Fast, friendly service; comfortable seating and Wi‑Fi
 - Local sourcing and seasonal menu items

 ## Target Customers

 - Students and freelancers

 ## Revenue Streams

 - Beverage sales (espresso-based drinks, drip coffee, tea)
 - Food sales (pastries, sandwiches, bakery items)
 - Retail (bags of coffee, merchandise)
 - Catering / bulk orders for local businesses (optional)

 ## Cost Structure

 - Rent and utilities
 - Labor (baristas, manager)
 - Cost of goods sold (coffee beans, milk, pastries)
 - Equipment (espresso machine, grinder, POS)
 - Marketing and payment processing fees
 - Insurance, licenses, and small repairs

 ## Pricing Guidelines

 - Price drinks to target a 65–70% gross margin on beverages after COGS
 - Use bundle pricing (coffee + pastry) to increase average ticket

 ## Operations

 - Store hours: e.g., 7am–5pm Mon–Fri, 8am–4pm Sat
 - Staffing: 2–3 baristas during peak, manager/owner oversight
 - Inventory cadence: weekly restock for perishables; monthly for supplies
 - Daily opening & closing checklists (cleaning, cash reconciliation, equipment warmup/flush)

 ## Key Metrics (KPIs)

 - Daily customers
 - Average ticket value
 - Sales per labor hour
 - Gross margin %
 - Food waste / spoilage rate
